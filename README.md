# wish-list

This project is a simple wish list implemented with the MEAN stack.

Using a local MongoDB instance and a RESTful API combined with an Angular front-end, you can manage the items that are on your wish list.

On page load, your wish list appears. You are able to add, edit or delete items with the (required) name and (optional) notes fields. The input forms utilize Angular validation.

To better expose project structure and coding practices, the Gulp and .env files have been exposed in the repo â€” only the compiled build files are in gitignore.

All technologies used: HTML5, Bootstrap 3, Angular, UI-Router, JavaScript, Express, Node.js, Mongoose, MongoDB, Gulp.
